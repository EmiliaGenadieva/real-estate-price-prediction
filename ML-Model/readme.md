# Description
In this part of the project, the data is being preprocessed for Machine Learning. The data is cleaned in such a way that the ML Model can process and analyze it.
This means that there are no null and categorical values in the data file.
Each peace of the code is provided with a comment, which describes it's purpose. In the preprocessing file one can find usable code for the different types of data encoding(filling the null values).
The main file 'ml-creation' contains a pipeline. This is reusable and compact way of defining the steps in the preprocessing of the data, fitting the model and displaying the results of the performance.

# Installation
The code provided in this repo is reusable.
# Usage
The column names are particular to the immo project.
